README - Can you give me a discount?

---

**Project Status: Incomplete**

---

So this project involved using one of the patterns we learnt to develop a shopping cart where the items can receive discount.

---

**Completed Tasks:**

1. Implemented the ShoppingCart class to manage shopping cart items.
2. Implemented the ShoppingCartItem class to represent items in the cart.
3. Implemented the Product class to represent products with prices.
4. Implemented the Discount interface with three concrete implementations (PercentageDiscount, AbsoluteDiscount, ChooseTheBetter).
5. Created JUnit tests in the ShoppingCartTest class to validate the system's functionality.

---

**Known Issues:**

Two test methods, `shoppingCartWithChooseTheBetterDiscount` and `shoppingCartWithPercentageDiscount`, are currently failing.

---

**What I plan to do during my free time:**

1. Review and debug the failing test methods to identify the root cause of the issues.
2. Make necessary adjustments to the code to ensure all test cases pass successfully.
3. Consider additional improvements such as enhanced documentation and error handling.
